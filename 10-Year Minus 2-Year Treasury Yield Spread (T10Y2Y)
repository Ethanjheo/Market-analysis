## Recession Shading and Key Insights

The shaded gray areas on the chart represent official U.S. recession periods as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).  
A negative yield spread (inversion) has historically preceded recessions by several months to over a year.

## Interpretative Summary

- The **10-2 yield spread inversion** has consistently preceded U.S. recessions, making it one of the most reliable early-warning indicators.  
- Recent prolonged inversion since 2022 marks a record in duration but has not yet been followed by a deep recession.  
- Historically, the **return to positive spreads (disinversion)** often coincides with the actual onset of recessions.  
- While highly reliable, the indicator should be interpreted alongside broader macroeconomic and financial conditions.
