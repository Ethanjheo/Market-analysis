# My Analysis

## 1. Triangle Formation
![Triangle Formation](2025-09-15_chart1.png)

- The **first chart** shows a **triangle consolidation pattern**, which frequently occurs in **Wave 4**.  


## 2. Projection for Wave 5
![Wave Projection](2025-09-15_chart2.png)

- Given the triangle in Wave 4, it is reasonable to anticipate a **downward move in Wave 5**.  
- This aligns with the Elliott Wave principle where a final leg often completes after consolidation.
- The triangle is connected to the **zigzag correction in Wave 2**, forming a **cross pattern** (see orange marking in chart 2).

## 3. Elliott Wave Structure

- In the **second chart**, the movement can be interpreted as an **AB(wxy)C (impulse)** upward sequence.  
- This structure supports the view that the upward move may already be completed.
- The **third chart** shows that from the ABC structure, the retracement falls within the **0.5 ~ 0.618 Fibonacci levels**.  
- This zone strengthens the bearish bias, suggesting a potential decline.

## 4. MACD Divergence on 4H

- The **fourth chart** (`2025-09-15_chart4.png`) highlights a potential **MACD bearish divergence** on the 4-hour timeframe.  
- If confirmed, this divergence increases the probability of a **trend reversal to the downside**.  
- Divergences, when aligned with Fibonacci rejection zones, often enhance the reliability of bearish setups.

## 5. External Variable
- A major **variable is the FOMC meeting on September 17**, where a potential **interest rate cut** could influence volatility and trend direction.

### Conclusion
- **Primary Bias**: Triangle in Wave 4 → Downward Wave 5 scenario.  
- **Key Levels**: Watch 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone.  
- **Risk Factor**: FOMC announcement may disrupt technical patterns.
