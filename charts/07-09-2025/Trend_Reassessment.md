---

### 1. Long-Term Perspective
- **Elliott Wave Context**:  
  - In the long run, the **Wave B bullish scenario** remains valid.  
  - A medium-term upward structure is still plausible, but not immediately confirmed.  

---

### 2. Short-Term Observation
- **Trendline break detected** on the recent chart.  
- The short-term market direction **contradicts the bullish scenario**, showing stronger downside pressure.  
- As a result, the **previous long bias is invalidated**, and a reassessment is required.

### 3. Re-Evaluation

- **Timeframe Adjustment**:  
  - Using higher timeframes (4H, 1D) results in poor risk/reward.  
  - Re-evaluating with the **1H chart** provides a more favorable risk/reward balance for short trades.
