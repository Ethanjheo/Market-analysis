---

### 1. Current Observation
- **Pattern:** Falling Wedge (potential bullish reversal pattern)  
- **OBV (On-Balance Volume):** Continuously declining → mid-to-long term bearish signal  
- **However:** Short-term reversal potential exists at this level.  
- **Key Conditions:**  
  - Bounce above the green trendline (support) → short-term reversal possible  
  - Breakdown below the green trendline → risk of Elliott Wave **3-3 downward wave**  

---

### 2. Interpretation
- **Bullish Scenario (Reversal):**  
  Due to the nature of the Falling Wedge, a breakout above the upper resistance line could serve as a strong bullish reversal signal.  

- **Bearish Scenario (Further Decline):**  
  If the price closes below the support trendline, it may trigger an Elliott Wave 3-3 decline, leading to a sharp drop.  

- **Conclusion:**  
  This zone is a critical **inflection point**, and any trading decision should involve a clearly defined stop-loss line.  

---

### 3. Indicators & Confirmation
- **MACD:** Currently in a correction phase → reversal signals are still weak.  
- **OBV:** Volume-based indicator shows strong downward pressure.  
- **Overall:** Short-term bounce possible, but structurally the risk of sustained bearish continuation remains high.
