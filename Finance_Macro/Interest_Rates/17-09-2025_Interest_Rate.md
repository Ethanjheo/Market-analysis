# Interest Rates

## Definition of Interest Rates
An interest rate refers to the rate of return paid for borrowing capital. It represents the “price of capital” and is one of the most crucial variables in economic activity.  
Interest rates are generally divided into **nominal rates** (not adjusted for inflation) and **real rates** (adjusted for inflation).  

## Functions of Interest Rates
1. **Price signal of capital**: Guides investment and consumption decisions  
2. **Balance between savings and investment**: Regulates the flow of funds between households and firms  
3. **Key tool of monetary policy**: Enables central banks to curb overheating or stimulate recessions  

## History of U.S. Interest Rates
- **1970s–80s**: Interest rates raised above 20% to fight inflation (Volcker shock)  
- **Early 2000s**: Rates lowered after the dot-com bust and the 9/11 attacks  
- **2008 Global Financial Crisis**: Zero interest rate policy adopted  
- **2020 COVID-19 Pandemic**: Ultra-low rates with quantitative easing  
- **Since 2022**: Rapid hikes to contain inflation  

## Global Influence
U.S. interest rates serve as a **de facto global benchmark**:  
- Directly affect capital inflows and outflows in emerging markets  
- Drive volatility in dollar exchange rates  
- Influence international commodity and oil prices  

## Case Study: September 17 Rate Cut
- Decision: –0.25% cut  
- Market expectation: –0.50% cut  
- Outcome: Disappointment led to a **decline in the NASDAQ**  
→ Demonstrates that the **“surprise effect”** of policy moves has a strong impact on asset prices.  

## Investment Strategies by Interest Rate Cycle
According to André Kostolany’s investment principles:

1. **When rates fall**
   - Prepare to sell bonds (risk of price decline)  
   - Buy equities and real estate (capital inflow)  
   - Buy gold (hedge against inflation and liquidity expansion)  

2. **When rates rise**
   - Buy short-term bonds (safe-haven demand increases)  
   - Sell equities and real estate (capital outflow)  
   - Prepare to sell gold (pressured by strong dollar and higher yields)  
   - Increase deposits and savings  

## Additional Considerations
- **Yield curve (spread between short- and long-term rates)**: A widely used indicator of potential recessions  
- **Real rates vs. expected inflation**: Key determinant of capital allocation  
- **Central bank forward guidance**: Markets react more to **future signals** than to the rate change itself  

## Personal Reflection
Interest rates are more than just a financial variable; they signal the dynamics of national economies, global markets, and individual strategies.  
For South Korea, as a trade-dependent economy, responses vary depending on the relative level of U.S. interest rates.  

- If **Korea’s rate is higher than the U.S.**, foreign capital inflows increase. This strengthens the won, which benefits the domestic market but disadvantages exports.  
- If **Korea’s rate is lower than the U.S.**, foreign capital outflows occur, weakening domestic demand but supporting exports through a weaker won.  

Thus, interest rates cannot be judged in isolation—they must be understood within political, social, and national objectives.  

From an individual perspective, interest rates guide allocation between gold, bonds, savings, equities, real estate, and even Bitcoin. Understanding interest rates is therefore the starting point of sound portfolio management. Switching assets based on rate cycles amplifies effectiveness.  

Hence, investors must consider not only the **level** of interest rates but also the **pace of change, deviation from expectations, and global spillover effects**.
